# virm

Virm is a terminal-based file remover that uses your preferable CLI text editor to let you easily nuke files and directories. It is inspired by [vimv](https://github.com/thameera/vimv) which is a great bulk-rename terminal-based utility.

## Installation

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/mazzensaadd/virm.git
$ cd virm
$ sudo cp virm /usr/local/bin/
```
